  question: What are the reasons for the Bedouin rejecting Islamic teachings?
  answers:
  - Feeling that Islamic teachings are against the nomadic lifestyle and their freedom
  - Considering Islam as the religion that governs their daily lives
  - Having a conflict of interest with Islamic values especially related to changes
    in lifestyle and social procedures
  - Assuming that the teachings of Islam are not relevant to the lives of those who
    focus on the life of the desert and hunting
