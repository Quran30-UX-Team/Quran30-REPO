  question: Why did Prophet Zakaria ask for prayer to get a son?
  answers:
  - '"Because he was worried about who would continue the religious duties after
    his death"'
  - Because he wants to have an heir who will inherit the property from him
  - Because his wife wants to have a child to accompany them in old age
  - Because he felt incomplete as a Prophet without having children
