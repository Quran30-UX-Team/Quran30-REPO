  question: Why does Allah take testimony from Adam's grandchildren in the spirit
    world?
  answers:
  - So that they do not say in the afterlife that they do not know the oneness of
    God
  - So that they follow the teachings of the apostles later on

  - So that they follow the steps of the devil in the world
