  question: 'Why did Prophet Khidir destroy the boat owned by the poor? '
  answers:
  - '"Because he knew that there was a king who would seize every boat  which is
    good by force"'
  - Because he intended to steal equipment from the boat
  - Because he meant to punish the poor people who owned boats
  - Because he wanted to test the patience of Prophet Moses
