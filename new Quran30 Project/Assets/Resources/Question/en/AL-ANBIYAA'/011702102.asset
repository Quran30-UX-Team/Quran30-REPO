  question: Why is it that people who make fun of the Prophet and the Book are said
    to perish?
  answers:
  - They rejected and mocked the reminder of monotheism and the day of retribution
  - They are too busy with worldly affairs
  - They pay attention to the afterlife
  - They did not repent while still alive
