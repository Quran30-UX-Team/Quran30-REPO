  question: '"""And don''t the disbelievers know that the heavens and the earth were
    both one thing first, and then  We separated the two and from water We created
    all living things, so why do they not believe?""  Why does God reprimand the
    disbelievers in verse 30 of Surah Al-Anbiyaa''?"'
  answers:
  - Because they do not believe in Allah despite seeing His greatness in His creation
  - Because they do not know that the heavens and the earth were originally united
  - Because they say that they are gods other than Allah
  - Because they do not take lessons from the events of the universe
