    his preaching against idols?

  - '"Do you come to us in earnest or are you one of those who play games?"'
  - '"You and your father are in wrong path"'
  - '"Indeed your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth who has created them"'
  - '"I will plan against your idols after you leave them"'
