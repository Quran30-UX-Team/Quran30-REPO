  question: Why should we fight the people of the book who oppose the teachings of
    Islam?
  answers:
  - They are willing to say that Prophet Muhammad SAW is not a Messenger
  - Because they are creatures in the form of demons
  - Because they worship only the Book
  - Because they don't want to pay jizya
