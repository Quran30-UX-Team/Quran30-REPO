  question: What is meant by garment of piety based on the verse below?O children
    of Adam! Indeed We have sent down to you (materials for) clothes to cover your
    private parts and clothes for jewelry; and the clothes that are in the form of
    piety are the best. That is one of the signs (of abundant grace) ) Allah (and
    His mercy to His servants) so that they remember him (and be grateful).
  answers:
  - Do obedience to Allah
  - Clothes that cover the aurat perfectly
  - Beautiful clothes to decorate
  - Clothes that protect yourself from heat and cold
